# sim_cal.cpp


Include Necessary Header Files:
Begin by including the necessary header files for input and output operations in C++. You will need the <iostream> header.

Declare Variables:
Declare variables to store the two numbers on which the calculations will be performed. You may also need variables to store the result and the operator.

Take User Input:
Use cin statements to take input from the user for the two numbers and the operator.

Perform Calculation:
Implement logic to perform the desired calculation based on the operator entered by the user. This may involve using conditional statements (e.g., if, switch) to determine the operation.

Display Result:
Use cout to display the result of the calculation to the user.

Compile and Run:
Once you have written the code, compile it using a C++ compiler and run the program to test the calculator.
